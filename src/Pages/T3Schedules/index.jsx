              digitalization process of your public transport system. This service
                 is the first step in creating GTFS Static feeds. It will help you to
             understand the static topology data of your transit network, and
              serve as the foundation for collecting data from vehicles operating
              on routes. This data, when combined with our T2 Performance transit
             service, empowers you to gain insights into the performance of
                vehicles assigned to specific routes, as well as visualize time
              bands and start creating schedules."

                            Our system analyzes historical trip data to identify significant trip
                            counts in 15-minute intervals throughout the day for different day types
                            and route directions. It highlights time bands with consistent departure

                            Additionally, the system tracks real-time vehicle counts and visualizes
                            them for different routes during the day. It calculates and displays the
                            Passenger Capacity for each route direction based on the maximum
                            registered passenger capacity for each vehicle.

                            During peak hours, you can prioritize departure frequencies in the
                            Dynamic Schedule for outbound or inbound directions. Time band editing
                            allows adjustments to departure frequencies by altering the time band's
                            upper level.

                            For more significant changes, vehicle blocks can be modified, and the
                            system will update trip expectations and frequency time bands. Export
                            the dynamic schedules as GTFS Static files covering the entire transit
                            network.
