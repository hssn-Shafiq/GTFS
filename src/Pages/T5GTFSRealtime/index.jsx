                detail="   GTFS Realtime serves as an extension to GTFS Static, offering
                real-time information about the status of a service journey. The
                primary benefits include reduced wait times, as passengers can time
                their arrival at stops or stations more precisely, reduced travel
                time through informed trip choices, and ultimately increased public
                transit use due to improved efficiency. The higher-order impact
                stands to be even greater: envisioning a future where integrated
                real-time data from all transportation options enables a true
                mobility system that rivals the convenience of private car usage."
