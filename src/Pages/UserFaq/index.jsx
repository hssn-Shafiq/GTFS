          <p>This problem could occur for a couple of reasons.
  
              Firstly, if your email address is already registered with Bus Mate, you don’t need to sign up
              again! Please reset your password (link) instead.
  
              Secondly… Like most of you, we prefer to feel confident in the identities of our partners to
              avoid heartbreak! If you try to join us using a commercial email address (for example, an
              @gmail.com or an @hotmail.com email address), we may reject your sign-up attempt. Try using an
              organisational email instead. If you don’t have one, there are other ways we can get to know one
              another—give us a call instead.</p>

              make sure our email hasn’t gotten caught up in your spam filter by accident. If you’re still
              having trouble, contact us with your email address, organisation name and contact number and let
